          <p class="description">
            Visual Communication Design student with a strong passion for
            graphic design, branding, and 3D visuals. I enjoy crafting visual
            stories that connect creativity with purpose, bringing ideas to life
            through thoughtful design. Currently, I'm expanding my skills in
            UI/UX design to create intuitive and engaging digital experiences.
            My goal is to combine aesthetics and usability to deliver designs
            that leave a lasting impact.

                  Rhythmic Geometry is an abstract geometric motion graphic
                  animation that combines basic shapes such as circles, squares,
                  and triangles with contrasting colors like light blue, yellow,
                  magenta, white, and black. The dynamic and rhythmic movements
                  create a modern, playful, and visually balanced impression.
                  This work represents the harmony between form and color
                  through continuously shifting compositions, symbolizing
                  energy, creativity, and a vibrant visual rhythm.

                  Asthera was born from the idea of elegance meeting confidence.
                  The flowing curves and bold structure of its letters tell a
                  story of grace, strength, and self-assurance — a balance
                  between softness and power. Set against a deep maroon
                  background, the logo carries a sense of timeless beauty and
                  quiet luxury. It represents more than just a name; it embodies
                  a vision — of a brand that dares to shine with sophistication
                  and individuality.

                  simple, functional, yet full of joy. Each object, from the
                  vibrant drinkware to the quirky inflatables, invites a sense
                  of fun and creativity. The composition feels alive, reflecting

                  Empressa is an homage to the rebellious spirit and fierce
                  elegance of Cruella, capturing the raw, anarchic energy of
                  London's punk-infused fashion scene. Rendered as a dynamic
                  digital mixed-media piece, the artwork employs a striking
                  palette of black, white, and dramatic splashes of blood-red,
                  creating a visual texture that mimics the tactile intensity of
                  acrylic brushstrokes and street spray paint. The central
                  figure stands poised beneath the bold declaration "DEVIL," her
                  face obscured by the defiant statement "THE FUTURE,"
                  signifying a vision that is both ruthless and visionary.

                  The Platinum Icon is a powerful graphic reinterpretation of
                  Marilyn Monroe, designed specifically for the sharp, reductive
                  constraints of the linocut technique. This piece utilizes
                  stark, high-contrast lines reminiscent of classic Pop Art to
                  capture the raw drama of her iconic features and blinding star
                  quality. The explosive halo effect behind her head symbolizes
                  the relentless, dazzling impact of her fame and image.

                  Monochrome Abundance is an abstract study of density and
                  light, transforming the organic form of pomegranate arils into
                  a compelling graphic composition. Rendered in a stark black,
                  white, and gray palette, the artwork emphasizes the jewel-like
                  clustering of the seeds, where each sphere is a micro-universe
                  of glossy reflection and deep shadow. The deliberate use of
                  contrast highlights the cellular structure beneath, turning a
                  simple fruit into a complex landscape of volume and void.

                  Urban Dreamscape is a vibrant commentary on the dynamic
                  intersection of daily life and imaginative escape within the
                  modern metropolis. This mixed-media piece overlays whimsical,
                  hand-drawn characters and playful symbols onto a
                  photorealistic backdrop of towering skyscrapers and bustling
                  Jakarta city streets. The floating figures—one carrying a box
                  of aspirations, another lost in a book—represent the varied
                  pursuits and inner worlds of individuals amidst urban
                  grandeur. The scattered objects, from pencils to musical
                  notes, symbolize the continuous flow of ideas, creativity, and

                  Samyang: Ignite represents a bold new chapter for the iconic
                  instant noodle brand, reimagined for a contemporary global
                  audience. This rebranding initiative focuses on distilling
                  Samyang's core essence—its intense flavor and signature
                  heat—into a sleek, modern visual identity. The new logo,
                  prominently displayed in this mockup, features a stylized bowl
                  of ramen subtly integrated with a vibrant chili pepper, its
                  flame graphic embodying the brand's exhilarating spice. The
                  clean, robust typography of "Samyang" projects confidence and
                  quality. This design evokes a sense of both heritage and
                  innovation, promising a refreshed experience that continues to
                  ignite passion for flavor, connecting with a new generation
                  while honoring the loyal fans who crave its unmistakable kick.

                <p class="subtitle">
                  Nine Lives Scratchpad is a playful, tactile Zine designed to
                  celebrate the anarchic joy and mysterious elegance of cats
                  through the distinctive aesthetic of Risograph printing. Using
                  a high-contrast palette of magenta, yellow, and blue, the
                  artwork features bold halftone textures and graphic
                  illustrations of feline antics. The layout is intentionally
                  dynamic, merging text sections like "Favorite Things" and
                  "SCRATCH SQUAD" with vibrant, overlapping imagery. Crucially,
                  the Zine is designed as an interactive piece, meant to be
                  folded, cut, and perhaps rearranged by the reader, mirroring
                  the unpredictable, multi-layered nature of a cat's life. It is
                  not just a publication, but an energetic, print-textured
                  experience dedicated to all things meow—a loud, colorful
                  explosion of nine lives captured on paper.
